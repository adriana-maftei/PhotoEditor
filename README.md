This project is a Photo Editor app made with Visual Studio & C# programmming language. The EXE file is available in the "bin" folder. Main features I learned and build while developing this project:

- working with WinForms 
- making UI elements (buttons, interactions, track bars) 
- creating a functional open & save system for Image files (.png .bmp .jpg)
- working with file dialogs
- creating color filters
- creating RGB color track bars for photo editing
